##AA analysis
goals of analysis
look at metals at different sites (compare means?)
instrumentation - compare how ICPMS and AA differ for Cr

loading data
```{r}
AA <- read.csv("~/CHEM313_L4_SoilLab/data/tidy_AA.csv")
```
defining lists
```{r}
sample_sites <- unique(filter(AA, site!="MB", site!="")$site)
```
making cal curve
```{r}
cal <- AA %>%
  filter(type == "CalStd" | type == "CalStd2" | type == "CalStd4") %>%
  select(concentration, mean_abs, percent_rsd)
  
model <- lm(cal$mean_abs ~ cal$concentration)
slope <- model$coefficients[2]
intercept <- model$coefficients[1]
slope_std <- summary(model)$coefficients[2,2]
intercept_std <- summary(model)$coefficients[1,2]
  
plot(cal$mean_abs ~ cal$concentration,
     xlab = "Concentration of Cr (ppb)",
     ylab = "Absorbance") +
  abline(model, col="blue") +
  title("Calibration for Cr")

AA_cal <- tibble(slope, slope_std, intercept, intercept_std)
AA_cal
#clean up
rm(cal, slope, slope_std, intercept, intercept_std, model)
